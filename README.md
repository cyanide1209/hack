# hack4humanity 2023

#Purpose:
  #the objective of this hackathon project was to analyze how how efficient each nonprofit charity is in America through an analysis of the IRS Form 990s.
  #By balancing their program expenses over total expenses we were able to determine which charities were best for people to donate to based on their efficiency which we   #measured as program expenses/total expenses. 
  #The goal of this project was to help people make wise decisions in determining which charity to donate to
 
#How it Works:
  #Through access to the IRSâ€™s public files, we obtained and cleaned a list of Form-990s 
  #We placed sorted data into a database and then called the database into the React website
  #We sorted the website by efficiency with both ascending and descending order
  #Color coded based on efficiency
